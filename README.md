# PinFo
A location based Android application that allows users to share points of interest with the people around them.


## About PinFo
PinFo is an application that I developed for my final year project at university. At its core PinFo aims to improve users' lives. It does this by providing them with the extra detail about their surroundings. Allowing them to meet new people and discover new places without the risk of disappointment.


## Features
The current version of PinFo is 1.0, which was last updated on May 11th 2017.


In this version the following features are included:

* Login/Sign up system, which is provided by Firebase.
* Placing a new pin on the map, using either your current location or one that you specify. 
* Account page to check your previous pins and your pin points score.
* The ability to vote either positively or negatively on other users pins.
